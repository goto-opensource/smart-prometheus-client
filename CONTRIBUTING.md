# Contributing

We gladly take pull requests on GitHub. You can also simply discuss the change you wish to make via issue or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please follow these guidelines to make it easier for us to merge your pull requests:

1. Please use the same formatting (use the default formatting provided by [gpls - go language server](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls)

1. Make sure your changes are covered by a unit-test

1. use conventional commit for the title of your pull request. We use squash-and-merge, so the list of commits in the main history follows this convention.
